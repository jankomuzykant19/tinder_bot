# tinder_bot
Autolike bot for tinder (21.04 working)

You need to download chromedriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org) that fits your Chrome version.
How to check Chrome version (https://help.zenplanner.com/hc/en-us/articles/204253654-How-to-Find-Your-Internet-Browser-Version-Number-Google-Chrome)
Then in the file 'tinder_bot.py' set path to that file in the 6th line.

This program does not store any of your data.

Due to Tinder changing their website, bot may stop working. If that happens please let me know so that I will repair it.
